//! `capture`: what is on a monitor, asked for by the logic. Two questions,
//! both answered at once (`sys.ask`), both with `services: "capture"`:
//!
//! - `capture.pixel(x, y[, output])`: the colour at a point, `"#rrggbb"`. A
//!   colour picker. Without `output`, `x` and `y` are on the desktop, in the
//!   compositor's logical units (the monitor that holds the point is found);
//!   with it, inside that monitor (`screen.name`), as a full-screen surface's
//!   pointer reads them.
//! - `capture.freeze(output)`: the whole monitor, as it is now, kept in memory
//!   and named `capture:DP-1?3`, which `image … = from` paints like a live
//!   window's frame. What a region picker draws under its rectangle, so that
//!   what is picked does not move while it is picked. A monitor's last freeze
//!   is kept until the next one of that monitor replaces it.
//!
//! Spoken in the standard protocols, on a connection of its own (a monitor
//! that goes away halfway through a copy can at worst end this connection,
//! never the one the scene draws on): wlr-screencopy, which wlroots
//! compositors, Hyprland, niri and pleamar-wm ship, and ext-image-copy-capture
//! with its output source where the compositor has it. A pixel is asked of
//! wlr-screencopy first, as a small region around the point, which is made upright
//! here; the pixel inside it is the one the point is on, from the monitor's
//! scale. A freeze is asked of ext-image-copy-capture first. Either one
//! alone is enough. xdg-output says where each monitor is and how big, in
//! logical units.
//!
//! Surfaces with `captures: hidden` are left out by the compositor that
//! honours it (pleamar-wm does, for every capture): nothing to do here.
