//! `thumbnails`: every window of the desktop, with a small picture of it —an
//! overview, a switcher, a dock's previews—, including windows the scene does
//! not host. Spoken in the standard protocols: ext-foreign-toplevel-list to
//! know the windows, ext-foreign-toplevel-image-capture-source to name one,
//! and ext-image-copy-capture to copy it. Any compositor that ships them
//! (pleamar-wm, Hyprland, sway, niri…) works the same; where they are missing,
//! the windows are listed with no picture.
//!
//! Nothing is copied until the logic asks for it (`thumbnails.want`, the ids
//! it shows, or "all"), and then only when the window changes: the compositor
//! holds each frame until there is something new, and here no more than a few
//! a second are taken. A frame with the same pixels as the last one —Hyprland
//! fills every frame waiting on a monitor when anything on it redraws— is
//! nothing new: no file is written and nobody is told. Each picture is made small (`SIDE` at most) and written
//! as a PNG under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/pleamar/thumbnails`; `picture` is that
//! path with a version (`…/3.png?12`), which `image … = from` paints and
//! reloads as it changes.
//!
//! `thumbnails.live` asks the same of the windows an overview shows moving:
//! their frames skip the file. Each one is kept here, in memory, as it came,
//! and `picture` names it (`thumbnails:3?12`); `image … = from` takes it from
//! here and makes it the size it is drawn at. Up to `LIVE_EVERY` a second,
//! and still only when the pixels change. A window no longer asked for live
//! gives its frame back as a file, so a whole frame is never held for nobody.
//!
//! Where the compositor offers it (its session names a card and BGRA layouts
//! of one plane the render reads), a live window is copied on the card instead:
//! the render makes the buffer (`wants`, answered with `offer`), the compositor
//! fills it, and the render reads it once `ready` has come, into the size it is
//! drawn at, with nothing passing through memory. Each window falls back to the
//! memory copy on its own, if the card cannot be used for it.
//!
//! A window the compositor stops copying keeps its last picture, and `stale`
//! says it. Only the compositor can say so (the session `stopped`): a frame
//! that does not come is the same, from here, whether the window did not
//! change or the compositor will not copy it —Hyprland copies only windows that
//! overlap a monitor, so a column scrolled away waits for good, not stale—.
